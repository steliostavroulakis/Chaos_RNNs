# On Scrambling Phenomena for Randomly Initialized Recurrent Networks

Included are experiments that empirically explain our theoretical findings about chaotic behavior of RNNs.

Experiments are in the form of jupyter notebooks with comments.
* Persistence of Chaos - Feedforward NNs.ipynb
* Persistence of Chaos - Recurrent NNs.ipynb
* RNNs and Chaos - Distance Figure.ipynb
* RNNs and Chaos - Period 3 Probability
* Higher Dimensions
