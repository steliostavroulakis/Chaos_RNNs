# Beyond Exploding Gradients in Recurrent Neural Nets: Scrambling Phenomena and the Persistence of Chaos

Included are experiments that empirically explain our theoretical findings about chaotic behavior of RNNs.

Experiments are in the form of jupyter notebooks with comments.
* Persistence of Chaos - Recurrent NNs.ipynb
* Persistence of Chaos - Feedforward NNs.ipynb
